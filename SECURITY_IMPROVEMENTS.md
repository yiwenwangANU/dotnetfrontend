# Security Improvements Documentation

## JWT Storage Migration Guide

### Current Implementation (Security Risk)
The application currently stores JWT tokens in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Any malicious script can access localStorage and steal authentication tokens.

### Recommended Implementation (Secure)
Migrate to httpOnly cookies for JWT storage. This prevents JavaScript from accessing the tokens, significantly reducing XSS attack surface.

### Migration Steps

#### 1. Backend Changes Required
The .NET backend needs to be updated to:
- Set JWT tokens as httpOnly cookies in the response
- Read JWT tokens from cookies in requests
- Implement CSRF protection

Example backend implementation:
```csharp
// When setting the JWT token
Response.Cookies.Append("token", jwtToken, new CookieOptions
{
    HttpOnly = true,
    Secure = true, // Only send over HTTPS
    SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict,
    Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7)
});
```

#### 2. Frontend Changes

Update the login hook to remove localStorage usage:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useLogin.ts
onSuccess: (res: LoginResponse) => {
  toast.success(`Welcome back, ${res.userName}!`);
  // Remove these lines:
  // localStorage.setItem("token", res.token);
  // localStorage.setItem("userName", res.userName);
  
  // The token will be automatically set as httpOnly cookie by the backend
  router.push("/");
}
```

Update the axios instance to include credentials:
```typescript
// src/api/api-instance.ts
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  withCredentials: true, // This ensures cookies are sent with requests
});

// Remove the Authorization header interceptor since cookies will be used
```

Update middleware to check for cookie instead of localStorage:
```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
const token = request.cookies.get('token')?.value
// Already implemented correctly!
```

#### 3. CSRF Protection
Since cookies are vulnerable to CSRF attacks, implement CSRF tokens:

1. Backend generates CSRF token and sends it as a regular cookie (not httpOnly)
2. Frontend reads CSRF token and includes it in request headers
3. Backend validates CSRF token on state-changing operations

### Additional Security Improvements Implemented

1. **Security Headers**: Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.ts`
   - Strict-Transport-Security
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - Referrer-Policy
   - Permissions-Policy

2. **Route Protection**: Implemented middleware for protecting authenticated routes

3. **Environment Variable Validation**: Added runtime validation for required environment variables

4. **Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error handling across all API calls

5. **Production Code Quality**: Removed all console.log statements from production code

### Testing the Migration

1. Test login flow with httpOnly cookies
2. Verify CSRF protection on state-changing operations
3. Test that XSS attempts cannot access the JWT token
4. Ensure proper logout clears the httpOnly cookie
5. Test cookie expiration and renewal

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:
1. Keep localStorage implementation as fallback
2. Use feature flags to gradually roll out cookie-based auth
3. Monitor for authentication issues in production

### Timeline

1. Week 1: Backend implementation and testing
2. Week 2: Frontend changes and integration testing
3. Week 3: Security audit and penetration testing
4. Week 4: Gradual rollout to production
